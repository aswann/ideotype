# ideotype

### Motivation
Over the next three decades rising population and changing dietary preferences are expected to increase food demand by 25–75%. At the same time climate is also changing — with potentially drastic impacts on food production. Changes in __crop characteristics__ and __management practices__ have the potential to mitigate some of the expected decrease in yield due to a changing climate. However, a substantial knowledge gap remains for which of these adaptation techniques are likely to be most effective at any point in time, the mechanisms through which they can mitigate yield loss, and the relative effectiveness of different approaches. 

We use a process-based crop simulation model (MAIZSIM) to explore how different crop traits and agricultural management options affect maize growth and yield, with the hope to identify ideal trait and management combinations, known as __ideotypes__, that maximize yield and minimize risk for different agro-climate regions in the US.
